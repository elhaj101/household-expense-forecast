## Functionality
The software includes key functions such as:

- Greeting the user based on the time of day.
- Displaying a list of predefined spending categories.
- Collecting the user's name and monthly salary, with input validation.
- Collecting monthly spending amounts for each category.
- Showing a menu with various options for user interaction.
- Calculating current monthly and annual savings based on salary and spending.
- Allowing users to analyze potential savings by reducing spending in selected categories.
- Forecasting savings and expenses over the next 12 months.
- Saving user data to a Google Sheet.
- Loading user data from a Google Sheet.
- Resetting the system to clear user data.
- Quitting the system with a farewell message.
- Running the main program and managing user interactions.

## Readability
The code is structured to be readable, following proper indentation and including comments that clarify the purpose of functions and sections.

## Input Data Handling
The code includes multiple input validations to ensure that user data is correct. Here are the key aspects:

1. Name Input Validation
   - The name must only contain letters and spaces. If invalid, the user is prompted to re-enter it.

2. Salary Input Validation
   - Salary must be a positive number. Negative or non-numeric inputs prompt the user to re-enter.

3. Spending Amount Validation
   - Spending amounts for each category must be non-negative numbers. Invalid inputs prompt re-entry.

4. Menu Option Validation
   - Users must select valid menu options. Invalid selections prompt re-entry.

5. Category Selection Validation
   - Users must enter valid category numbers. Invalid inputs prompt re-entry.

6. Percentage Reduction Validation
   - The percentage reduction for a category must be between 0 and 100. Invalid inputs prompt re-entry.

7. Google Sheets Data Validation
   - The number of data columns must match the headers in the Google Sheet. Mismatches prevent saving.

8. Data Loading Validation
   - The program checks if the user's name exists in the Google Sheet. If not found, an error message appears.

9. Error Handling
   - Errors during Google Sheets API operations are caught and managed gracefully, providing user feedback.

### Summary of Input Handling
- Data type validation ensures inputs are correct.
- Range validation confirms inputs are within acceptable limits.
- Format validation checks that inputs meet expected patterns.
- Error handling provides clear prompts for invalid inputs.
- Data integrity ensures saved and loaded data is consistent.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into small functions, each addressing specific tasks. This modular approach enhances readability, maintainability, and testing.

## Testing
The software has undergone manual testing and debugging to verify functionality. Linter checks were conducted to maintain code quality.

 # Steps to Enable Google Sheets API

## Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project
1. Go to the **Google Cloud Console**.
2. Click on the project drop-down and select **New Project**.
3. Enter a name for your project and click **Create**.

## Step 2: Enable the Google Sheets API
1. In  project dashboard, click on **APIs & Services** > **Library**.
2. Search for "Google Sheets API" and click on it.
3. Click **Enable**.

## Step 3: Create Service Account
1. Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**.
2. Click on **Create Credentials** and select **Service Account**.
3. Fill in the service account details (name, description) and click **Create**.
4. In the next step, you can assign roles. For basic access, select **Editor** or **Viewer**. Click **Continue**.
5. Click **Done**.

## Step 4: Generate Service Account Key
1. After creating the service account, you will be redirected to the service accounts page. Click on the service account you just created.
2. Go to the **Keys** tab and click **Add Key** > **Create New Key**.
3. Choose **JSON** as the key type and click **Create**. This will download a JSON file containing your service account credentials (e.g., `creds.json`).

## Step 5: Share Google Sheet with Service Account
1. Open the Google Sheet you want to access.
2. Click on the **Share** button in the top right corner.
3. In the **Share with people and groups** window, enter the client email from your downloaded JSON file (it looks like `your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`).
4. Set the permissions (e.g., **Viewer** or **Editor**) and click **Send**.

## Step 6: Link to Your Code
1. Ensure your `creds.json` file (the one you downloaded) is in the same directory as your Python script.
2. In your Python script, add the following lines to authenticate and access your Google Sheet:

    ```python
    from google.oauth2.service_account import Credentials
    import gspread

    SCOPE = [
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets",
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file",
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"
    ]

    CREDS = Credentials.from_service_account_file('creds.json')
    SCOPED_CREDS = CREDS.with_scopes(SCOPE)
    GSPREAD_CLIENT = gspread.authorize(SCOPED_CREDS)
    SHEET = GSPREAD_CLIENT.open("expense_tracker")  # Replace with your Google Sheet name
    ```

## Step 7: Run Your Code
Now that everything is set up, you can run your Python script. It should authenticate with the Google Sheets API and interact with your specified Google Sheet without any issues.


### Issue and solution

- issue:
 Repeated saves create duplicate entries instead of updating.
 ![Placeholder Image](assets/images/issue1.png)
 ![Placeholder Image](assets/images/issue1.2.png)

- solution:  

- Get the worksheet.
- Get all records as a list of dictionaries.
- Loop through each record, check if the 'Name' matches.
- If found, note the index, calculate the row number (index + 2).
- Prepare the row data as a list, same as before.
- Use sheet.update(row_number, [row_data]) to update that row.
- If not found, append the row as before.
